### This repository is generated, not hand-authored

⛔ **Read this before editing anything under `senzing-bootcamp/`.**

The Power at [`senzing-bootcamp/`](senzing-bootcamp) is **build output.** It is produced
from the upstream Senzing bootcamp template release by a transformation contract,
and [`senzing-bootcamp/.build-manifest.json`](senzing-bootcamp/.build-manifest.json)
records the release it came from plus a SHA-256 for every file in the tree.

Each entry in that manifest carries an `owner`:

| `owner`    | Where the content is authored                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `template` | The upstream template release. Ported by a contract rule.         |
| `kiro`     | Kiro-specific, no template source. Authored in the build tooling. |

Hand-editing a file in this tree makes the build and this repository disagree, and
the next rebuild silently reverts your change. The `Validate power` workflow fails
on exactly that condition: it recomputes every SHA-256 in the manifest and reports
any file whose content no longer matches.

So a fix to Power content belongs upstream:

- Content that came from the template (`owner: template`) is fixed in the template
  release, or in the transformation contract that ports it.
- Kiro-specific content (`owner: kiro`) is fixed in the build tooling that authors it.

If you have made a deliberate, reviewed change to the tree anyway, recompute the
manifest hashes in the same commit so the tree stays self-describing, and say in
the pull request why the change could not be made upstream.

### Setting up a development environment

#### Set environment variables

These variables may be modified, but do not need to be modified.
The variables are used throughout the installation procedure.

```console
export GIT_ACCOUNT=Senzing
export GIT_REPOSITORY=senzing-bootcamp-kiro-power
```

Synthesize environment variables.

```console
export GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR=~/${GIT_ACCOUNT}.git
export GIT_REPOSITORY_DIR="${GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR}/${GIT_REPOSITORY}"
export GIT_REPOSITORY_URL="git@github.com:${GIT_ACCOUNT}/${GIT_REPOSITORY}.git"
```

#### Clone repository

Get repository.

```console
mkdir --parents ${GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR}
cd  ${GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR}
git clone ${GIT_REPOSITORY_URL}
cd ${GIT_REPOSITORY_DIR}
```

### Testing

The same checks CI runs are runnable locally, and they need no Senzing install and
no MCP server:

```console
python3 .github/tools/validate_power.py senzing-bootcamp
```

It reports, and fails on:

1. `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` against the [Agent Plugins] v1.0.0 schemas.
1. Every `skills/*/` directory has a `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter `name` matches
   the directory name.
1. Every `.build-manifest.json` entry still matches the file on disk, and no file
   in the tree is missing from the manifest.
1. Every `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/…` path referenced by the shipped content resolves to a
   file that exists.
1. Every shipped Python script compiles.

Add `--json` for the same answer as data.

### Locally testing a change to the Power

Install the tree from disk rather than from GitHub, so you are testing your working
copy:

1. In Kiro's left-hand icon bar, click the **Powers** icon.
1. Under **Installed**, click **Add Custom Power**.
1. Select **Import power from a folder** and choose the `senzing-bootcamp/`
   directory of your clone.

Then start a session in an empty directory and say "start the bootcamp".
